					                    PROBLEMS
With such a large population in India, it is very difficult for an equitable and fair distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a report in the Times of India, it could take up to 2 yrs. to provide the vaccine to approx. 60% of the population. With the wide dissimilarity in the population demographics and inequitable distribution of resources among the population, it is important that scientific and organized systems are used. Thus, it is essential to have an ordered fast-paced system for providing the vaccine efficiently and without any prejudice. Nivaran targets this urgent issue and aims to provide a practical and implementable solution.
