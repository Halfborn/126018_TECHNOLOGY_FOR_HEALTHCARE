					                                 PROBLEMS
With such a large population in India, it is very difficult for an equitable and fair distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a report in the Times of India, it could take up to 2 yrs. to provide the vaccine to approx. 60% of the population. With the wide dissimilarity in the population demographics and inequitable distribution of resources among the population, it is important that scientific and organized systems are used. Thus, it is essential to have an ordered fast-paced system for providing the vaccine efficiently and without any prejudice. Nivaran targets this urgent issue and aims to provide a practical and implementable solution. 
			
			                                          
								         SOLUTION 
We are proposing a radically new solution to overcome this problem of distribution of the vaccine that is the need of the hour:
1) “Vaccination centers” will have to be created similar to the voting centers to vaccinate people in a particular area.
2) Each person living in the area will have to register themselves on the proposed Nivaran app by entering various details like name, age, Aadhar card, age, comorbidity, location as well as income level.
3) The app will then verify the credentials and will send an OTP based on the phone number linked with the Aadhar card.
4)After this, the people will be sorted based on their age, comorbidity, location as well as income level to select the people who need to be vaccinated on priority. This priority will be based on the algorithm made.
5) Based on this each person will be sent a QR code along with the date, time, and nearest center. The person will have to get his QR code scanned at the center to avail of vaccination. 
6) After vaccination, the person will receive a code which when entered in the app will generate a certificate that can be used for easy inter territory travel.
